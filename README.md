Homework 2 involves fetching data from this link: https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population. The data needed to be formatted into a table in HTML. 

The index.html file creates and formats a webpage where the table will be displayed. The table was styled using classes in HTML to connect to the styles.css file. The styles.css files adds borders to the table and shades the background of the header cells.

The j.js file fetches the data from the link. The data is fetched and then put into a table by using a for loop to edit the rows and cells of the table. Each cell is added in a specific row and then the row is appended to the table element.
